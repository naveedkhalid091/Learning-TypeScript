## What is Object oriented programming. 

The Object Oriented programing is not a programming language, It is a way of doing programming where you achive a certain pettern/objective by following steps. 

# Definition:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript is a programming paradigm that `based on class and Objects` to structure and organize code. OOP is based on `four main principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism`. 



* AS OOP is `based on class`, the `explaination of classes is given below`. 

1) Classes:
A class is made up of variables(Attributes) and methods(functions).

    i) Attributes.
    The attributes are just like variables, inside the class, variables never start with `let` or `const` keywords instead they are initiated by mentioning the names of variables only, that's why these are called attributes. (See Example in index.ts)

    ii) Methods:
    The Metheds are just like functions, but because we use them inside the classes that's why these are called Methods. Secondly, In these functions/methods you doesn't explicitely mention `function`, `let` `const` keywords.  

Class's body starts with its curly braces, 


(see code examples at index.ts file)

## Important Note on Classes:
** Any programming language which support `classes`, can ultimately implement OOP (e.g C++,C#,Java,TypeScript,JavaScript, Python etc). 

** Class is a reserve keyword in programming langiuages, you can't mention class keyword anywhere in the programming language. 

* The Name of Classes always start with a capital letter.

* Class is basically a `blueprint(Map)` of anything, `for Example`: You need to contruct a building then before constructing a building you need a map where rooms sizes, kitchen siezs, yard sizes and other details mentioned, Same is the case with `Class`, where class is a structure/blueprint of related object. 
But, you can't consturct a building from a map, you need a cement and bricks etc to construct a building and also you can't build 5 marla's home from the Map of 1Kanal's home. Same is the case with `class`, you can't build object with class, so every class has its own attributes and functionalities.

When you have clear undestanding of class, then you will have a knowledge of OOP. This is bcz all the OOP programming is based on Classes.
