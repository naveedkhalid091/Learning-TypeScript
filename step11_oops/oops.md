## OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

There are Four Pillers of OOP (Hint PIA-E). 
    i) Encapsulation. 
    ii) Inheritance.      
    iii) Abstraction.
    iv) Polymorphism. 

These are principleso f OOP, you can change the order as well, the order of these principles is not mendatory to follow. 


i) Inheritance 
The things/properties are coming from the parents(superClass) to childs(subclass).
The subclass/child can also extend functionalies by adding new properties same as childs can buy new properties other than the inheritance property. 

The `extends` keyword is used if child/subclass wants to axtend properties.  

(see Example at oops.ts)

ii) Encapsulation. 

Encapsulation in OOP refers to restricting an unauthorized access and mutaion of specific properties of an object. 
`Access Modifers`  are used to achive the Encapsulation. 
By Default, all class properties are public. This default behaviour can be Overridden by `Access Modiferes`

## Access Modiferes: 

An Access modifier is a keyword that changes the accessibility of a property in class. 

There are three primary Access Modifiers. 
 * Public - This is the default visibility of every class property, A public property is accesable outside the class. 
 * Private -  Video Timing 1.42.42
