You are adviced to always make your projects in small piece of chunks or by making your small targets. 

For Example: In this project, you have to make a `Number Guessing Game` so that user may able to correct the number and in return user is get rewarded for coins or something else. 

We have divided our project into following three targets/chunks so that we may able to prepare our whole project into small pieces. 

The Targets are given as: 

// 1) Computer will generate a random number.  (See the code)
// 2) User Input for guessing number. (See the code)
// 3) compare your guessed number with random number and show result? (See the code)
