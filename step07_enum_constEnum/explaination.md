An enum (short for "enumeration" in urdu it is called گنتی) 

The process of making a list of things one after another. 

Enum, is a symbolic name for a set of values. 
Enumerations are treated as data types, 
and you can use them to create sets of constants for use 
with variables and properties.

There are two types of enums in TypeScript: numeric 
enums and string enums. 

1. Numeric Enums
Numeric enums are the default. They assign a number to each member, starting from 0 by default.
You can also customize the starting value:

2. String Enums
String enums are initialized with string values rather than numeric ones.
